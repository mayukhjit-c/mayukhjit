  - Low-tier devices: 15 particles max
  - Medium-tier devices: 40 particles max  
  - High-tier devices: 80 particles max
  - Zero particles when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled
- **Battery-Aware Performance**: Monitors battery level and reduces particle counts by 50% when in low-power mode
- **Connection Speed Detection**: Detects slow-2g/2g/3g connections for adaptive loading
