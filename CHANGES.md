# Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Scroll Animation Glitches
**Problem:** When clicking header buttons, scroll animations would glitch before scrolling.

**Solution:**
- Improved smooth scroll function with better cancellation logic
- Added proper debouncing to prevent overlapping animations
- Added instant jump for very small distances (< 5px)
- Enhanced user interaction cancellation (wheel/touch events)
- Reduced scroll duration from 640ms to 500ms for snappier feel

**Files Modified:** `script.js` (lines 82-128)

### 2. Glow Effects Cutoff
**Problem:** Glow effects on cards and elements were being cutoff and not diffusing properly.

**Solution:**
- Changed `overflow: clip` to `overflow: visible` on `.card` class
- Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible` on `.thumb` class
- This allows box-shadows and glow effects to properly extend beyond element boundaries

**Files Modified:** `styles.css` (lines 580, 636)

### 3. JavaScript Error
**Problem:** "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getAttribute')" error at line 2705.

**Solution:**
- Added null check before accessing `activeEl` in requestAnimationFrame callback
- Added additional null check for text attribute before calling placeTooltip
- Ensures tooltip code gracefully handles cases where element reference is lost

**Files Modified:** `script.js` (lines 713-722)

### 4. Emojis on Webpage
**Problem:** Emojis were used throughout the site instead of SVG icons.

**Solution:**
- Removed all emojis from HTML content (ðŸš€, âš¡, ðŸŽ¨, ðŸ”§)
- Removed all emojis from JavaScript strings and comments
- Kept only SVG icons which are properly semantic and accessible

**Files Modified:** 
- `index.html` (multiple locations)
- `script.js` (multiple locations)

### 5. Code Organization
**Problem:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were in a single 4700+ line file.

**Solution:**
- Separated into three files:
  - `index.html` (701 lines) - Semantic HTML structure
  - `styles.css` (1282 lines) - All styling and animations
  - `script.js` (2753 lines) - All JavaScript functionality
- Linked external files in HTML head and body
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude backup files

**Files Created:** `styles.css`, `script.js`, `.gitignore`

### 6. Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Website was laggy with unnecessary CSS properties causing repaints.

**Solution:**
- Removed `will-change` properties from `.btn` and `.card` classes
- Removed `backface-visibility: hidden` where not needed
- These properties force layer creation and can cause performance issues
- Performance is now managed dynamically based on FPS monitoring

**Files Modified:** `styles.css` (lines 513-518, 590-595)

### 7. Text Content Humanization
**Problem:** Text sounded AI-generated and overly formal.

**Solution:**
- Simplified hero subtitle: "I care about clean code, fast sites, and user experience..."
- Made project descriptions more direct and personal
- Changed "Selected work I shipped..." to "Things I've built and shipped to real users"
- Added personal context: "Built it because I needed something better than scattered PDFs"
- Made CodeBuilder description more casual: "Still experimental but pretty cool"

**Files Modified:** `index.html` (multiple locations)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test smooth scroll by clicking navigation links repeatedly
2. Verify glow effects on cards display fully on hover
3. Check console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify all icons display correctly (no emoji replacements)
5. Test page load time and scrolling performance
6. Validate HTML, CSS, and JS files separately
